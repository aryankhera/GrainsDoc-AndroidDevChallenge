# Food Grains Health detector 
I'm a final year undergrad Mechanical Engineer and for my capstone project I'm working on grain storage solution for mid-scale farmers in India. Food Grain storage is one of the major issues which costs billions of dollars in losses each year. Me and my team have designed the silos and are working on the final prototype. We're going to use Raspberry Pi and Tensorflow Lite to detect fungal growth in grains using CNNs and Humidity Sensors. I want to bring the same solution to small scale farmers in the form of an app as buying silos and raspberry pi is uneconomical for them. Due to poor connectivity the ML model needs to be offline (on-device).


# Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
1) a list of the ways you could use Googleâ€™s help: I'm new to mobile development and Tensorflow and I need a clear path to study and make a cross-platform app (maybe using Flutter or React Native) before my capstone deadline.

2) Timeline:-
 Dec 2019: wireframe and prototype
 Jan 2020: Data collection and training of Tensorflow ML model (using CNN) 
 Feb 2020: UI of the app and User Testing
 March 2020: Alpha version

# About Me 
I'm a final year undergraduate pursuing my mechanical engineering from Thapar University, India. I'm a problem solver who loves to design products from mobile applications to payment system. Most recent example would be a hostel room swap application that I developed for the students who were allocated rooms against their will in the hostel allotment process. Another example would be a mobile payment system based on facial recognition and ethereum blockchain which I'm currently working on. It is part of my UX case study on mobile payment solutions in India.
